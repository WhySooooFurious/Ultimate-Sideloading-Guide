If you still have privacy concerns about the madNS Config Profile, make an issue on github with your email and i'll send you a viewing invite so you can see for yourself.

If you still have privacy concerns, use the WSF Config Profile, it uses a native iOS Configuration Profile method to redirect Apple Certificate Servers to https://localhost.direct, which is your own local network.
