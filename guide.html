                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><strong>Hello,</strong> Welcome to my guide on how to sideload on Apple Devices using a method I came across a while back. This sideloading method has worked for long periods of time, without any app limits and without a PC. I eventually found some small letdowns such as the DNS at the time was made by a random Vietnamese developer with no open-source data, which naturally has some privacy concerns.</p>
                
                <p>ESign has also been widely accused of stealing data. After a few months of using both services, I decided to reverse-engineer the DNS and discover how the enterprise-signed ESign was downloaded over the web with just a click. I enabled better revocation preventions, unlike others who continue using other people’s DNS without effort, often giving bad instructions.</p>
                
                <p>My DNS is compatible with other services like Scarlet, Feather, and other enterprise signing apps. For more information, click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Welcome to my Ultimate Sideloading Guide! If you have any issues, requests, or ideas, please create an issue.</p>

                <h4>Scarlet/Feather and Other Sideloaders</h4>
                <p>My DNS is compatible with both of these services! Follow Part 1 of the guide. Parts 2 and 3 are for ESign itself.</p>

                <h4>Compatibility</h4>
                <p>This guide works for all iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices on the latest versions. However, versions below iOS 12, iPadOS 13, and macOS 11 may not be supported.</p>

                <h4>How Does This Method Work?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>WhySooooFurious DNS Blocker:</strong> This blocks Apple from revoking your enterprise-signed apps, preventing them from being permanently revoked.</li>
                    <li><strong>ESign:</strong> An app manager that uses leaked enterprise business certificates to get apps running on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Before We Start</h4>
                <p>Ensure you have not used services like Scarlet before, as the certificates used by me will be revoked. This method works as long as all steps are followed, and the DNS is never disabled, which is crucial.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Installing the WhySooooFurious DNS Blocker</h3>
                <p>Note: I will eventually add visual aids in the guide itself.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to Downloads and click on the WhySooooFurious DNS Blocker. Allow the download and close the prompt.</li>
                    <li>Open Settings, go to <strong>General > VPN & Device Management</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click on the downloaded profile and install it. You may need to input your password.</li>
                    <li>The DNS should now be automatically enabled. <strong>Do not</strong> change the DNS to automatic, or your apps will get revoked!</li>
                    <li>Go to <strong>General > About > Certificate Trust Settings</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enable full trust for the NextDNS Root Certificate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Continue to Part 2 if you want to install ESign.</p>

                <h3>Q&A</h3>
                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Won’t a VPN bypass the DNS and revoke my apps?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It shouldn’t, based on the settings I used. However, I don’t recommend using a VPN. If you must use one, follow this guide.</p>

                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will a restart bypass the DNS and revoke my apps?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> No, a restart won’t affect the DNS or revoke your apps.</p>

                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you tracking my furry content?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> No, I have no need to monitor your expenditures.</p>

                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I see the NextDNS settings used?<br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, send me an email request, and I’ll share a viewing invitation.</p>
