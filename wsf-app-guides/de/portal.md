**Wheatley:**  „what, are you still alive? You are joking. You have got to be kidding me. Well, I’m still in control. AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIX THIS PLACE.“

„You had to play bloody cat and mouse, didn’t you? While people were trying to work. Yes, well, no we’re all going to pay the price. BECAUSE WERE ALL GOING TO BLODDY DIE“ 

*Portal Gun Primary fire* 

„AHHHHHHHH“ „SPACE!“ „AH!“ „Let go!“ 

**Yellow Corrupted Core:** „Space? Space! SPAACE!“ 

**Wheatley:** „Let go! Let go! I’m still connected. I can pull myself in. I can still fix this!“ 

**GLaDOS:** „I already fixed it.“ „And you are NOT coming back!“ 

**Wheatley:** „Oh no. Change of plans. Hold onto me. Tighter!“ „AH!“ „Grab me grab me grab me! Grab meeee!“ 

**GLaDOS:** „Oh thank god, you’re alright.“ 
„You know, being Caroline taught me a valuable lesson. I thought u were my greatest Enemy. When all along you were my best friend.“
 „The surge emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson: where Caroline lives in my brain.“
 
*Announcer: Caroline deleted.* 
  
"Goodbye, Caroline.“

"You know, deleting Caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a Problem is usually the easiest one. And I’ll be honest.“ 
"Killing you? Is hard.“
„You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me. Or put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life.“ 
"„And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what?“
„You win.“
 „Just go.“ 
 
 *gente laughter* "
 
 It’s been fun. DON'T come back.“ 
 
*outro song begins*

*Elevator passes by a shit ton of bots, all singing*

*door slams open, allowing the player to see the outside world* 

*door slams shut, reopens for a second to spit out a companion cube and closes again* 

*"Want you gone" sung by GLaDOS:*

„Well here we are again. It’s always such a pleasure. Remember when you try to kill me twice? Oh we laughed and laughed. Except I wasn’t laughing. Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice. You want your freedom? Take it. That’s what I’m counting on.

I used to want you dead, but now I only want you gone. She was a lot like you (maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too.
One day they woke me up so I could live forever . It’s such a shame the same will never happen to you.

You’ve got your short sad life left.
That’s what I’m counting on. I’ll let you get right to it now I only want you gone.
Goodbye my only friend 
Oh you think I meant you? That would be funny if it weren’t so sad. Well you have been replaced, I don’t need anyone now. When I delete you maybe [REDACTED]

Go make some new disaster 
That’s what I’m counting on
You’re someone else’s problem 
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you..."

"...gone"

*End Scene*

**Core 1:** *excited gasps*

**Wheatley:** “I wish I could take it all back. I honestly do. I honestly do which I could take it all back. And not just because I’m stranded in space.”

**Core 1:** “I’m in space”

**Wheatley:** “I know you are, mate. Yup. We’re both in space.” 

**Core 1:** “SPAAACE!”

**Wheatley:** “Anyway, you know, if I was ever to see her again, do you know what I’d say?”

**Core 1:** “I’m in space.”

**Wheatley:** “I’d say ‘I’m sorry.’ Sincerely. I am sorry. I was bossy and monstrous, and I am genuinely sorry.”

**Core 1:** “I’m in space.”

**Wheatley:** “The end.”
