## [Post Install Notes](accent://)

Some guidelines to follow to ensure your apps don't get revoked.

As of recently, Apple has started using a new domain to revoke sideloaded applications. We can block the domain although it will stop you from installing new apps.

As a result, you have to use the INSTALL ONLY variant when installing apps:
Settings > General> VPN & Device Management > Restrictions and Proxies > Config Profile you picked

After utilising the INSTALL ONLY variant, you have to switch back to any other profile to ensure you won't get revoked

- You must never disable the Config Profile!

- Don't enable 2 Config Profiles at the same time

- Go into Airplane Mode if you're switching Config Profiles!

- Disable WiFi and enable Airplane Mode when wanting to Shutdown, Restart and Update!

- You cannot use a VPN unless you've followed the VPN Setup guide!

- Check for Updates, Announcements and Certificate Information in Portal regularly!
