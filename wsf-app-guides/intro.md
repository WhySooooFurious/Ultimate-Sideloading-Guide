### [How does this method work?](accent://)

By using leaked business enterprise certificates, We can sign apps using their credentials, meaning Apple lets us install the apps without any hassle, however after a while Apple revokes the certificate which can be easily bypassed by using this method.

We have made our own app called "Portal" and it contains all links to ESign, Feather, GBox and Scarlet inside the app itself!

### Unsupported Methods

We don't support other guides that use services such as NextDNS as those have limits, and apps will revoke if you pass that limit. They will also have no instructions on how to use our app called Portal.

The madNS Config Profile itself uses NextDNS and is transparent as we could make it. It is run for by donators and will keep running for as long as possible.

### [Before we start](accent://)

- This might not work for you if you've been using other enterprise sideloaders as the certificates might be revoked on your device!

- If you are revoked you will need to follow the Revoked guide!

- This will work as long as you read and do all of the steps properly!

### [Compatibility](accent://)

This should work for all iOS and iPadOS devices on the latest iOS versions, won't work for iOS 15 and below. The guide is compatible with other sideloading services as long as they rely on enterprise certificates to install.

### [Privacy](accent://)

You can view the privacy report [here](https://nch.pl/s/rKBAY59pNcX5bpJ/download?path=%2F&files=maDNS%20Config%20Profile%20Privacy%20Report.pdf&downloadStartSecret=5en4k2r6yuv)

If you still have privacy concerns about the madNS Config Profile, make an issue on GitHub with your email and i'll send you a viewing invite so you can see the settings for yourself.

Make sure to mention exactly what the madNS's profile name is so I can give it to you!

If you STILL have privacy concerns, use the WSF Config Profile, it uses a native iOS Configuration Profile method to redirect Apple Certificate Servers to https://localhost.direct, making sure it will never reach Apple and revoke your apps!
