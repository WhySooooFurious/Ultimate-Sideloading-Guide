## How does this method work?
By using leaked business enterprise certificates, We can sign apps using their credentials which means Apple lets us install the apps without any hassle, however after a while Apple revokes the certificate which can be easily bypassed any of the two profiles below,

The WhySooooFurious Configuration Profile redirects Apple servers to https://localhost.direct (which is your own local network) which prevents Apple from contacting your device about the revoked certificate.

The (redacted) Configuration Profile simply blocks these Apple Servers instead of redirection. This method also supports VPNs, ChatGPT and Feather properly unlike the WhySooooFurious Configuration Profile
