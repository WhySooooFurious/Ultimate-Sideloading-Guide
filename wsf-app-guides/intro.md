## How does this method work?
By using leaked business enterprise certificates, We can sign apps using their credentials which means Apple lets us install the apps without any hassle, however after a while Apple revokes the certificate which can be easily bypassed by using this method.

## Before we start

- This might not work for you if you've been using other enterprise sideloaders as the certificates might be revoked!

- If you are revoked you will need to follow this the Revoked guide in the Micellaneous section!

- This will work as long as you read and do all of the steps required!

## Compatibility
This should work for all iOS and iPadOS devices on the latest versions. The guide is compatible with other sideloading services as long as they rely on enterprise certificates to install.
